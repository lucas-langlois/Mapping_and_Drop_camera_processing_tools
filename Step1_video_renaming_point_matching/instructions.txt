How to use the video renaming and point matching app

Before you start 

1) Place all your videos in the "Videos" folder
2) Download your point data collection layer from ArcGIS online (export as excel to preserve date/time format). Copy/Paste the Point_ID (or OBJECTID) column, the Date_Time (in UTC), other relevant metadata field (SG_PRESENT, DEPTH...) to new .csv. Save the .csv in "data" folder. This will be used for the matching the videos to the points.


Launch Rstudio and run launch_app.R

The interactive app will start.

Check the video directory path is correct
Browse to select your newly created .csv in the data folder
Enter the location of the survey
ID prefix is just add something before the unique point ID
Set how many digit you want your unique IDs
Specify the name of your Date/Time column in the csv
Specify the name of your point ID columns
Specify format of the date/time column
Specify the time zone format of your Date/Time column
Specify the time zone used by your camera (e.g. for DJI it will be the time showing in the filename)
Set the maximum time difference to allow a match (default is 300 sec) 

When all set
Hit preview matches - check that everything looks good. If some don't match check if you need to increase time diff but be careful as it might double match others.
If all looks good hit "rename videos" this can't be undone so only do it when you are sure. There is a log that get's created with the original filenames if you need to revert by clicking the "Download log" button
